# CREATAVA

## intorduction
This project is used to creat the AVA-formation dataset that usually used in action recognition. 
In the past, it is really hard owing to that we should use object detection and track model first.
Luckly, we have [YOLOv8](https://ultralytics.com/yolov8) model now, which means we can detection and track the object at one times.

So this project use the [YOLOv8](https://ultralytics.com/yolov8) to help us building the AVA-formation dataset, which is really quick and easy.
